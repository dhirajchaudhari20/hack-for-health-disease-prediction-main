# My Awesome Project

Welcome to My Awesome Project! This project does amazing things and makes your life easier.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get started with My Awesome Project:

### 1.Overview :
Predictive systems for diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease involve applying machine learning techniques to datasets containing relevant features. Here's an overview of each:

#### Diabetes Prediction System:
Features:

Input features often include age, BMI, Number of Pregnancies, blood pressure, glucose levels, and lifestyle factors.
Data Collection:

Gather a diverse dataset with sufficient instances of both diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, outliers, and perform normalization or standardization.
Model Selection:

Common models for diabetes prediction include support vector machines.
Training and Evaluation:

Train the model on a subset of the data and evaluate its performance on a separate testing set, using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance.
Deployment:

Deploy the model for predicting diabetes in new data, and regularly monitor and update it as needed.


#### Heart Disease Prediction System:

Features:

Input features may include age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking status, and medical history.
Data Collection:

Assemble a comprehensive dataset with a mix of individuals with and without heart disease.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing data, outliers, and normalize or standardize the features.
Model Selection:

Common models for heart disease prediction include SVM.
Training and Evaluation:

Train the model on a portion of the data and evaluate its performance on a separate testing set, using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Deployment:

Deploy the model to predict heart disease in new individuals, with ongoing monitoring and updates.


#### Parkinson's Disease Prediction System:

Features:

Input features may include MDVP,HNR,Shimmer,Jitter.
Data Collection:

Assemble a dataset with information from individuals with and without Parkinson's disease, including various clinical measures.
Data Preprocessing:

Address missing values, outliers, and standardize or normalize features.
Model Selection:

Common models for Parkinson's disease prediction include decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.
Training and Evaluation:

Train the model on part of the data and evaluate its performance on a separate testing set, using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize performance.
Deployment:

Deploy the model for predicting Parkinson's disease, with streamlit io.
